<div>
    A url of result for display in pingcode.
    if empty, the jenkins console result url will be used.
    <br />

    You can use environment variables for dynamic variable substitution in the url.

    <br />
    For example: http://jenkins-host/result-${BUILD_ID}, which means that the url is dynamically generated using the
    BUILD_ID. All
    environment
    variables injected by the plugin can be used. If the environment variable does not exist, the source character will
    be retained.
